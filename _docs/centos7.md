CENTOS 7
--------

Most relatively modern/current distributions that use systemd have a fairly
modern version of it. The most notable exception is CentOS 7, which ships with
systemd 219. We provide a backport of more modern systemd releases (usually
tracking the latest stable) in
[facebookincubator/rpm-backports](https://github.com/facebookincubator/rpm-backports).
